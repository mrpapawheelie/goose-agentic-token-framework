# Agents

This directory will house agents (automation scripts, bots, or strategies) contributed by developers during future hackathons or community events.

- Developers can contribute new agents by placing their code here.
- You don't need to do anything with this directory right nowâ€”everything is set up to scale across a community, so contributors can quickly jump in and help.

Feel free to add documentation or examples as the agent ecosystem grows!
