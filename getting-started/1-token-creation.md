# Agent Token Name Generator

**Formula:**  
**[Prefix Word] + [Descriptor or Action Word] = Agent Name**  
→ Suggested **Ticker** (4–6 chars, unique, easy to type)

> **Note on Naming:**  
Alliterated token names follow **phonetic alliteration**, meaning they repeat the same sound, not just the same starting letter. For example, **Phantom Flux** works because "Ph" and "F" create the same "fuh" sound. This gives you more creative freedom while keeping the names catchy and memorable.

# 🧠 Choose Your Token Framework

When launching your token, one of the most important choices you'll make is how it's distributed. There are **6 distribution models**, each with tradeoffs in price stability, slippage, and market cap dynamics.

---

### 🧮 Distribution Models

| Model   | Description                                                                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Flat**     | 🚨 Most ruggable. Easy to pump market cap quickly, but also easy to drain. High risk if you don't control most of supply. |
| **Linear**   | Simple, slightly more stable than flat. Better for moderate growth while keeping some control. |
| **Quadratic**| Balances early liquidity with some late-stage resistance. Ideal for more fair launches. |
| **Cubic**    | More resistance as price climbs. Slower to grow market cap but builds stronger price floors. |
| **Quartic**  | Great for stable growth with decent slippage protection. Strong mid-to-long-term floor. |
| **Quintic**  | 🛡️ Maximum stability, minimum slippage. Requires deeper pockets to raise market cap. Best for long-term value. |

> **📝 Tip:** If you're optimizing for low slippage and strong price floors, **Quintic** is your best bet.  
> If you're trying to pump market cap and you're controlling most of the supply, **Flat** is viable—but beware: traders will wreck you if you don't have full control.

---

### ⚙️ Borrowing Settings

Next, you'll choose whether to **enable borrowing** for your token.

- ✅ **Borrowing ON** (Recommended):  
  Token holders can borrow against their tokens *risk-free* with a **5% repayment fee**. As the token creator, you receive **40% of that fee**.  
  This boosts user engagement while rewarding you directly.

- 🚫 **Borrowing OFF**:  
  Disables borrowing. Less complexity but also fewer incentives for holders to engage with your token.

> **Best Practice:** Leave **borrowing enabled** unless you have a specific reason not to. It benefits both you and your community.

---

### 🤖 Agentic Setup (Optional but Smart)

You can configure your token to work with **agentic strategies**—automated agents designed to grow your token's visibility, liquidity, and buy pressure.

Examples:
- An agent that auto-trades using Cordexium Signals
- An agent that triggers dev buys based on momentum
- An agent that bridges liquidity or stakes profits

Set this up during launch or come back and add it later.

---

### 💰 Purchase Amount

Based on the model you choose, the amount of tokens you receive will vary:

- **Flat**: Get the most tokens—but weakest defense. Not ideal unless you control the market.
- **Quintic**: Fewer tokens up front—but each one is worth more. Strong floor, strong hands.

> **Reminder:** Don't let the number of tokens fool you. It's about control and floor strength, not quantity.

---

### 🔁 Buy & Sell Fees

These fees fuel your token's **incentive pool** and **boost rewards** every two weeks. Choose carefully:

- **Buy Fee:**  
  - 🔥 Tempted to go high? Don't. High buy fees turn off new buyers.  
  - 💡 Recommended: **1%** (Default), **Max: 2%**

- **Sell Fee:**  
  - Should be worse than borrowing to push holders toward staking, not dumping.  
  - 💡 Recommended: **5–8%**

---

### 🧪 Final Step: Add Your Token Research

Once your model is selected:

1. Go to [research.heurist.ai](https://research.heurist.ai)
2. Run a **deep research query** for your token (**$1–2 USDC**)
3. Copy the output markdown
4. Paste it into your GitHub repo under:

# Creating the Perfect Token

Follow these guidelines to create a memorable, discoverable, and professional token. You can use the sample AI prompts below to help brainstorm ideas.

## 1. Ticker (Symbol)
- **Requirements:**
  - Unique (not already used by another token)
  - Easy to spell
  - No more than 6 characters (so it can be cashtagged, e.g., $TOKEN)
  - **Do not use 'Goose' or 'Agent' in your ticker.**
- **Reasoning:**
  - Common or long tickers are hard to find and use on social platforms.
- **Good Examples:**
  - ZYNTH, BLAZE
- **Bad Examples:**
  - TOKEN (too generic), AGENTIC (too long), ETH (already taken), CRYPTO123 (too long, not memorable), GOOSE, AGENT
- **Sample AI Prompt:**
  > Suggest 10 unique, easy-to-spell, 4-6 letter token tickers for an AI agent project. Avoid common or existing crypto tickers, and do not use 'Goose' or 'Agent'.

## 2. Name
- **Requirements:**
  - Capital case, one word or max two words
  - Unique but easy to spell
  - If two words, use rhythmic alliteration (e.g., "MetaMind")
  - **Do not use 'Goose' or 'Agent' in your token name.**
- **Reasoning:**
  - Alliteration and rhythm make names more memorable. (e.g., "MetaMind" is alliterative, but try to be more unique)
- **Good Examples:**
  - BlazeBot, ZynthAI, BlazeByte, NovaNode
- **Bad Examples:**
  - GooseAgent, agentic token (not capitalized, two generic words), Crypto Token (too generic), The Best Agent (too long, not unique), MetaMind (too common)
- **Sample AI Prompt:**
  > Suggest 10 unique, catchy, capitalized token names (one or two words, using alliteration if two words) for an AI agent project. Do not use 'Goose' or 'Agent'.

## 3. Description
- **Requirements:**
  - Super short (max 66 characters)
  - Unique, clear, and states exactly what your token is for
- **Good Examples:**
  - "AI-powered agent for on-chain automation."
  - "A minimal, fast, and secure token for Web3 agents."
- **Bad Examples:**
  - "This is a token." (too vague)
  - "The best token for everything you need in crypto and more!" (too long, not specific)
- **Sample AI Prompt:**
  > Write a unique, clear, and concise (max 66 characters) description for a token that powers an AI agent for blockchain automation.

## 4. Icon
- **Requirements:**
  - Unique, minimalistic, and relevant to the name
  - Use simple lines, high contrast, and minimal detail
  - Should be recognizable at 32px size
- **Reasoning:**
  - Icons are often displayed very small; clarity and simplicity are key.
- **Tips:**
  - Avoid text or complex backgrounds
  - Use bold shapes and clear silhouettes
  - Make sure the icon stands out against both light and dark backgrounds
- **Sample AI Prompt:**
  > Describe a minimalistic, unique icon concept for a token named "BlazeBot" that would be recognizable at 32px and relevant to the name.

You can upload examples of good and bad icons for reference.
