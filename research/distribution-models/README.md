# Distribution Models Research

This directory contains research and documentation on different token distribution models. Each model has unique tradeoffs in price stability, slippage, and market cap dynamics.

## Summary TL;DR
- **Flat:** Fastest to pump, but highest risk of being drained. Only safe if you control most of the supply.
- **Linear:** Simple and slightly more stable than flat. Good for moderate, controlled growth.
- **Quadratic:** Balances early liquidity with late-stage resistance. Fairer for launches.
- **Cubic:** Builds stronger price floors as price climbs, but grows market cap more slowly.
- **Quartic:** Stable growth, good slippage protection, and a strong mid-to-long-term floor.
- **Quintic:** Maximum stability and minimum slippage, but requires more capital. Best for long-term value.

## Models

- [Flat](./flat.md): üö® Most ruggable. Easy to pump market cap quickly, but also easy to drain. High risk if you don't control most of supply.
- [Linear](./linear.md): Simple, slightly more stable than flat. Better for moderate growth while keeping some control.
- [Quadratic](./quadratic.md): Balances early liquidity with some late-stage resistance. Ideal for more fair launches.
- [Cubic](./cubic.md): More resistance as price climbs. Slower to grow market cap but builds stronger price floors.
- [Quartic](./quartic.md): Great for stable growth with decent slippage protection. Strong mid-to-long-term floor.
- [Quintic](./quintic.md): üõ°Ô∏è Maximum stability, minimum slippage. Requires deeper pockets to raise market cap. Best for long-term value.
