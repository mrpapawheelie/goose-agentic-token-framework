# Research

This area is your hub for all token research and documentation.

- For research on token distribution models, see the [distribution-models](./distribution-models/) directory below.
- Add other research topics and files here as your project grows.

## Quick Links
- [Distribution Models Research](./distribution-models/)

---

To add your own research:
1. Create a markdown file in the appropriate subdirectory (e.g., `distribution-models/`).
2. Link to it from the relevant README for easy navigation.

# Token Research

To complete your token setup, you need to research your chosen distribution model and how it applies to your token.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Go to [research.heurist.ai](https://research.heurist.ai)
2. In the search bar, enter a query like:

   > How does the [YOUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL] model affect price stability, slippage, and market cap for a token like [YOUR TOKEN NAME]? What are the best practices for using this model in a competitive trading environment?

   **Example Query:**
   > How does the Quintic model affect price stability, slippage, and market cap for a token like BlazeBot? What are the best practices for using this model in a competitive trading environment?

3. Run the query (cost: ~$1â€“2 USDC).
4. Copy the markdown output you receive from the research tool.
5. Paste the markdown into a new file in this `research/` directory (e.g., `quintic-blazebot.md`).

**Tip:**
- Name your research file after your model and token for easy reference (e.g., `quadratic-zynthai.md`).
- This research will help you and your community understand the strengths and tradeoffs of your token's setup.
