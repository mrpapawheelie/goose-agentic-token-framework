# Case Studies

This directory is for case studies of real-world or simulated token launches. Here you can document:

- Launch strategies and outcomes
- Lessons learned
- Best practices
- What worked, what didn't, and why

## How to Contribute
- Add a new markdown file for each case study (e.g., `my-token-launch.md`).
- Summarize the context, approach, results, and key takeaways.
- Link to relevant research or distribution models if applicable.

Case studies help the community learn from experience and improve future launches.
